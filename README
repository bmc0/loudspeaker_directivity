This is a python script which generates graphs of loudspeaker directivity
characteristics from individual measurements. The required dependencies are
Matplotlib and NumPy.

Usage:
	loudspeaker_directivity.py [OPTION...]

Options:
	--interval=n         measurement interval in degrees (default: 10)
	--mirror-horizontal  use only positive angles for horizontal orbit
	--mirror-vertical    use only positive angles for vertical orbit
	-h, --help           show this help text

All input files must have the same number of data points and use the same
frequencies. No interpolation is done. The expected format is:

	<freq_Hz> <magnitude_dB>
	...

Everything after <magnitude_dB> (usually just phase) is ignored. Files
exported from Room EQ Wizard work (use "Export measurement as text").

Lines starting with '*', '#' or ';' are ignored.

Frequency responses must be named {h,v}<angle>.txt. 0° and 180° responses are
only read from the set of horizontal responses.

The listening axis response must be named listening_axis.txt. This could just
be a duplicate of one of the other files, or could be the listening window
instead. If listening_axis.txt is not provided, the axial response (0°) is
used.

You may specify a correction to apply to all files with correction.txt.

The output files are as follows:
	directivity.png            - Listening axis, total sound power, and DI
	directivity_h_pos.png      - Horizontal positive angles
	directivity_h_neg.png      - Horizontal negative angles
	directivity_v_pos.png      - Vertical positive angles
	directivity_v_neg.png      - Vertical negative angles
	directivity_contour_h.png  - Horizontal contours
	directivity_contour_v.png  - Vertical contours
